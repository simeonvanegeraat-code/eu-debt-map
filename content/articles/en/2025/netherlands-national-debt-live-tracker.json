    "body": "<h2>Why national debt matters</h2>\n<p>Public debt doesn’t only concern finance ministers. It shapes interest rates, inflation, fiscal policy and even the wider economy【897833315766633†L63-L64】. Under the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, EU member states agreed to keep their annual deficits below 3 % and their government debt below 60 % of gross domestic product (GDP)【530334603475006†L13-L18】. These rules—codified in the Stability and Growth Pact—are meant to prevent today’s borrowing from becoming tomorrow’s crisis. Yet more than a third of EU countries now exceed the 60 % debt threshold【530334603475006†L45-L46】.</p>\n\n<h2>The Netherlands in context</h2>\n<p>The Netherlands is often cited as a fiscally disciplined country. At the end of 2023, government debt stood at € 481 billion—about 45.1 % of the nation’s economic output【776956608598207†L74-L76】. This ratio had fallen to the lowest level in 15 years after pandemic‑related borrowing spiked in 2020【776956608598207†L96-L108】. A year later, provisional figures show that debt ticked up again: in the first half of 2025 total public debt rose by nearly € 1 billion to € 492 billion, equal to 42.7 % of GDP【79940727990255†L48-L52】. Eurostat data compiled by Trading Economics places Dutch general government debt at 42.7 % of GDP as of June 2025, the lowest level since late 2024【184117734292208†L131-L139】. In other words, the Netherlands remains comfortably below the EU’s 60 % ceiling and far below high‑debt nations like France and Italy, where debt ratios exceed 100 %.</p>\n\n<h2>A live window into Europe’s finances</h2>\n<p>The <em>EU Debt Map</em> transforms dry fiscal data into a living picture of Europe. The site uses each country’s most recent Eurostat figures as a baseline and projects them second by second to show how fast public debt grows—or occasionally shrinks【897833315766633†L16-L23】. It is an independent, educational visualisation (not an official statistic) based on Eurostat’s <code>gov_10q_ggdebt</code> series【897833315766633†L25-L26】. With one glance you can compare France’s towering € 3.42 trillion debt—rising by roughly € 9,115 every second【897833315766633†L45-L53】—with the more modest numbers of Estonia or Malta. The map also colour‑codes countries by whether their debt is rising (red) or falling (green)【897833315766633†L32-L33】 and links directly to each national ticker.</p>\n\n<h2>What the Netherlands ticker shows</h2>\n<p>On the Netherlands page, the Debt Map presents a live estimate of around € 491.7 billion【999472260105015†L13-L16】. The page reports how much the debt has changed since the previous quarter (+€ 930 million)【999472260105015†L19-L22】 and the approximate pace at which it rises—about € 118 per second【999472260105015†L23-L25】. These figures are derived by interpolating between the two latest Eurostat reference dates【999472260105015†L27-L35】, producing a dynamic counter that reflects whether the Netherlands is moving closer to or further away from the 60 % benchmark.</p>\n\n<h2>Why you should explore the map</h2>\n<p>Numbers alone don’t tell the whole story. By clicking through to the <a href=\"https://www.eudebtmap.com/country/nl\">Netherlands debt page</a> or its Dutch‑language counterpart, you can see the debt ticking in real time, compare it with neighbouring countries and appreciate the bigger picture. The visualisation makes abstract fiscal data tangible and encourages informed debate about taxation, spending and the sustainability of public finances. Whether you’re a student, policymaker or curious citizen, the EU Debt Map offers a new way to understand national debt—and the Netherlands’ place in Europe’s fiscal landscape.</p>"
