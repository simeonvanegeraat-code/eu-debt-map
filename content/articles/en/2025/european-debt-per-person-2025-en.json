But what does that really mean for individuals? If each country’s public debt were divided equally among its citizens, people in several EU states would face a personal bill above <strong>€50,000 per person</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Why the debt-to-GDP ratio doesn’t tell the full story</h2>\n<p>The most familiar indicator — <strong>debt as a share of GDP</strong> — shows how large a country’s debt is relative to its economy. It is useful for crisis risk, but it can hide the scale of debt for the average citizen. According to Eurostat’s Q1 2025 data, the ranking by debt-to-GDP still places Greece, Italy and France at the top, and Estonia, Luxembourg and Ireland at the bottom. Yet this picture changes once we look at debt per person.</p>\n\n<h2>The new lens: debt per person</h2>\n<p>Dividing total government debt by population highlights a different set of pressures — especially in wealthy economies where the absolute debt stock is large.</p>\n<p><strong>Top 5 EU countries by debt per person (illustrative point-in-time snapshot)</strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Belgium</strong> — €52,952 per person</li>\n  <li><strong>Italy</strong> — €49,139 per person</li>\n  <li><strong>France</strong> — €46,545 per person</li>\n  <li><strong>Austria</strong> — €42,679 per person</li>\n  <li><strong>Finland</strong> — €42,234 per person</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Countries like <strong>Belgium</strong> and <strong>Austria</strong> rise in this view, while ‘safe’ economies such as <strong>Ireland</strong> and <strong>Luxembourg</strong> can also appear high because of their smaller populations and large nominal debt stocks.</p>\n\n<h2>Hidden risks: wealth doesn’t mean immunity</h2>\n<p>The data suggests two broad risk profiles in Europe:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Solvency-pressure economies:</strong> Smaller or slower-growing countries (e.g., Greece, Portugal) where debt-to-GDP remains high and sensitive to growth shocks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Hidden-burden economies:</strong> Wealthy countries (e.g., Ireland, Austria, the Netherlands) where debt looks manageable as a share of GDP but is <em>very large</em> per person in absolute terms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With ageing populations and higher interest rates, these hidden burdens can become more challenging over time — even without a traditional “debt crisis.”</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n<p>Debt per person makes public finance tangible. It turns abstract billions into a clearer sense of the long-term fiscal promise each citizen inherits. In practice, both views are necessary:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Debt-to-GDP</strong> helps gauge short-term crisis risk and market pressure.</li>\n  <li><strong>Debt per person</strong> shows the scale of the long-run social and fiscal commitment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Explore the live data</h2>\n<p>See the interactive map at <a href=\"https://www.eudebtmap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EU Debt Map</a> to follow how each country’s debt evolves in real time.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<h3>About the author</h3>\n<p><strong>EU Debt Map Editorial Team</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.eudebtmap.com/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">About us</a> · <a href=\"mailto:contact@eudebtmap.com\">contact@eudebtmap.com</a></p>\n<p><em>Source: Eurostat public-debt data (Q1 2025) and population statistics as of 1 January 2025.</em></p>"
