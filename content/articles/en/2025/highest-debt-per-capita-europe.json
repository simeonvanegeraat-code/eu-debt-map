  "body": "<h2>The Invisible Price Tag</h2><p>When economists talk about national debt, they usually speak in percentages. <em>“Italy’s debt is 140% of GDP,”</em> or <em>“France has breached the 110% mark.”</em> These numbers are abstract. They describe the health of the state, not the burden on the citizen.</p><p>But what if we took the colossal national debts of Europe and divided them equally among every man, woman, and child? The results paint a radically different picture of the European Union—one that places a surprisingly heavy price tag on citizens of countries often considered 'wealthy'.</p><p>Using <a href=\"/methodology\">live data projections</a> and 2025 population demographics, we analyzed the <strong>Debt Per Capita</strong> across the EU-27. The results reveal a distinct '€50k Club'—countries where every newborn baby effectively starts life with a mortgage-sized share of public debt.</p><h3>1. Belgium: The Surprise Leader (€56,885)</h3><p>While the world looks at Italy or Greece, <strong>Belgium</strong> quietly takes the top spot for debt intensity per person among major EU economies. With a total national debt approaching <a href=\"/country/be\">€671 billion</a> and a relatively small population of 11.8 million, the math is unforgiving.</p><p>Every Belgian citizen now carries a theoretical public debt burden of nearly <strong>€57,000</strong>. Unlike southern European countries, Belgium’s high personal wealth often masks this public liability, but the pressure on future fiscal budgets is undeniable.</p><h3>2. Italy: The Heavyweight (€52,164)</h3><p>It comes as no surprise that Italy is near the top. With a massive <a href=\"/country/it\">€3 trillion mountain of debt</a>, the sheer scale of borrowing is hard to comprehend. However, because Italy has a larger population (almost 59 million) to shoulder this load, the per-capita figure is actually slightly lower than Belgium's.</p><p>Nevertheless, at over <strong>€52,000 per person</strong>, the burden remains critical. This figure explains why Italian bond yields are so sensitive to market changes; the load on each taxpayer is nearly at the breaking point.</p><h3>3. France: The Fast Riser (€49,945)</h3><p>France is currently the fastest-growing debtor in Europe in absolute terms. The French debt clock is ticking upwards at a rate that outpaces its neighbors. Currently hovering just under the €50k mark, France is likely to join the '€50k Club' before 2026.</p><p>The contrast with its neighbor, <a href=\"/country/de\">Germany</a>, is stark. The average German carries 'only' roughly <strong>€32,000</strong> of public debt—a difference of nearly €18,000 per citizen compared to the French.</p><h2>The 'Frugal' East</h2><p>On the other end of the spectrum, the map turns green. Eastern European and Baltic states continue to run remarkably lean operations. <strong>Estonia</strong> remains the EU’s poster child for fiscal discipline, with a debt per capita of just roughly <strong>€7,230</strong>. Bulgaria follows closely behind.</p><p>This divide creates a Europe of two speeds: the legacy economies of the West carrying heavy historical baggage, and the newer economies of the East traveling light.</p><h2>Does It Matter?</h2><p>Economists argue that public debt isn't like a credit card; it doesn't always need to be paid back to zero. However, the <em>cost</em> of that debt (interest payments) is paid by taxpayers. A higher debt per capita means a larger portion of your future taxes goes purely to servicing the interest on past spending, rather than funding schools, hospitals, or roads.</p><p><em>Want to see the live numbers for your country?
