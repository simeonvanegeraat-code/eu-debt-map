  "body": "<h2>The map is turning green</h2>\n<p>Anyone opening the <a href=\"https://www.eudebtmap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EU Debt Map</a> will see a chart dominated by red spots: countries where national debt is increasing every second. But one country in the north stands out: Sweden. The tracker for Sweden is colored green, indicating that its debt is not rising, but *falling*.</p>\n<p>This is no accident; it's the result of disciplined fiscal policy. While France (+€9,115/sec) and even the Netherlands (+€118/sec) are watching their debts grow, the live tracker for Sweden shows a negative number.</p>\n\n<h2>Top of the Class</h2>\n<p>Sweden has one of the lowest national debts in the entire European Union. Where the <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-governance/stability-and-growth-pact_en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Maastricht treaty</a> sets a limit of 60% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Sweden is spectacularly below it.</p>\n<p>Recent <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eurostat</a> figures and data from the Swedish National Debt Office (Riksgälden) confirm that the debt-to-GDP ratio is hovering around **33.5%**. For comparison, the Netherlands is at 43%, and the EU average is over 80%.</p>\n\n<h2>How do they do it (outside the Euro)?</h2>\n<p>A crucial difference compared to countries like the Netherlands and France is that Sweden does not use the Euro; it has its own currency: the Swedish Krona (SEK). This means they can determine their own monetary policy via their central bank, the Riksbank.</p>\n<p>This flexibility, combined with a strict fiscal framework, has paid off. The Swedish government recently even reported *budget surpluses*. Simply put: more money is coming in than going out, allowing the national debt to be actively paid down.</p>\n\n<h2>See the decline for yourself</h2>\n<p>It's fascinating to watch the Swedish counter run backward while its neighbors' trackers rise. Click on the <a href=\"https://www.eudebtmap.com/country/se\">Swedish national debt page</a> on the EU Debt Map and see for yourself what the 'Swedish model' looks like in real-time. Compare it to the rest of Europe and witness the contrast with your own eyes.</p>"
