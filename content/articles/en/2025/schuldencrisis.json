  "body": "<p><strong>Subtitle:</strong> As borrowing costs climb, European governments are forced to confront a new reality. The question is no longer <em>whether</em> debt is a problem, but <em>when</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For the first time in over a decade, money has a price again — and that price is now painfully visible in the budget offices of Rome, Paris, and Brussels.</p>\n\n<p>After years of ultra-low and even negative interest rates — a period when governments could borrow almost for free — the abrupt return of inflation and the European Central Bank’s (ECB) rate hikes have rewritten the rules of public finance.</p>\n\n<p>Countries that once refinanced old loans effortlessly with cheap new ones are now facing a harsh reality: refinancing costs billions more. According to the OECD, nearly 40% of public debt in advanced economies must be refinanced before 2027 — at far higher rates than before. This is not an abstract risk; it is a growing budget line that diverts money away from healthcare, defense, and the green transition.</p>\n\n<h2>The “Club of 100 Percent”</h2>\n<p>Markets and the European Commission are closely watching what has come to be known as the <strong>“Club of 100 Percent”</strong> — countries whose public debt exceeds their annual economic output.</p>\n<p>The 2024 figures are sobering. Greece still leads with a debt ratio of roughly 153%, but the real concern lies with larger economies: Italy (≈135%), France (≈113%), Spain (≈102%), and Belgium (≈105%).</p>\n<p>These countries are trapped in a dangerous loop: high debt makes them vulnerable to rising rates, and rising rates make it harder to reduce debt. You can explore the full <a href=\"https://www.eudebtmap.com/debt-to-gdp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ranking of debt-to-GDP ratios</a> to see how countries compare across Europe.</p>\n\n<h2>Brussels Tightens the Reins</h2>\n<p>The pandemic-era fiscal pause is over. With a (slightly) reformed Stability and Growth Pact back in force, Brussels is sending a clear message: deficits must come down. In mid-2024, the European Commission placed several countries — including France and Italy — under the <em>excessive deficit procedure</em>, effectively putting them on fiscal probation.</p>\n<p>This creates both political and economic tension. For France, the eurozone’s second-largest economy, the push to cut spending is politically explosive. The friction between national sovereignty and EU fiscal discipline is back. On the <a href=\"https://www.eudebtmap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interactive EU debt map</a>, the rising debt of these nations offers a live reminder of the growing urgency.</p>\n\n<h2>A Global Headache</h2>\n<p>Europe’s debt dilemma is part of a broader global pattern. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warns that worldwide public debt is on track to reach 100% of global GDP by 2029 — a level not seen since the aftermath of World War II.</p>\n<p>The world’s two largest economies are driving the trend. The United States now carries debt exceeding 120% of GDP. China’s official debt, at around 88%, looks moderate — but its <em>hidden local debt</em> is estimated at an additional 148% of GDP, weighing heavily on the country’s fragile property market.</p>\n<p>When the anchors of the global economy are this heavily indebted, the entire financial system becomes more fragile.</p>\n\n<h2>The Dutch Paradox</h2>\n<p>Amid this global tension, the Netherlands stands out as an exception — and a lesson in fiscal dynamics. In 2024, the Dutch government deficit widened, and nominal debt rose above €491 billion. Yet the country’s <em>debt ratio</em> fell to just 43.7% of GDP — well below the EU’s 60% threshold.</p>\n<p>How is that possible? Because the Dutch economy grew faster than its debt. This underlines a key truth: the absolute size of a country’s debt matters less than its <strong>debt-to-GDP ratio</strong>, the measure of what a nation owes compared with what it produces. It’s also why the <a href=\"https://www.eudebtmap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EU Debt Map</a> focuses on these ratios rather than just raw totals.</p>\n<p>For Italy and France, the lesson is clear: without growth — or with interest costs that choke growth — debt quickly becomes unsustainable. The silent crisis has already begun.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<h3>Further Reading</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/debt-to-gdp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What does debt-to-GDP really mean?</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/articles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">All articles and analyses</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Interactive map with live debt data per country</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"tag\"><em>Sources: European Commission, Eurostat, IMF, OECD, and national central banks.
