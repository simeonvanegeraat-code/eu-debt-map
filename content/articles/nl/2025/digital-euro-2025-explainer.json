A digital euro would be a European backbone.</li>\n  <li><strong>Future-proof money:</strong> other big economies are testing CBDCs; the EU doesn’t want to fall behind.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How might it work?</h2>\n<p>Design plans point to a <strong>two-tier model</strong>: the ECB issues digital euros; <strong>private banks and payment firms</strong> provide wallets and customer support.\nThis way, the ECB does not replace banks.</p>\n<p>Open questions the ECB and lawmakers still need to fix:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Holding limits:</strong> to stop people moving too much money out of bank deposits during a crisis.</li>\n  <li><strong>Fees:</strong> will basic payments be free for users and shops?</li>\n  <li><strong>Privacy rules:</strong> how to stop crime while protecting normal users’ data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Privacy and trust</h2>\n<p>Cash is private; digital payments leave a trail. The ECB says a digital euro will offer <strong>strong privacy</strong>, especially for small offline payments.\nCivil-rights groups worry about <strong>surveillance</strong>. Too little privacy reduces trust; too much privacy could make it hard to fight fraud and money laundering.\nFinding the <strong>right balance</strong> is key.</p>\n\n<h2>What could it mean for citizens?</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Universal acceptance:</strong> like cash, usable across the euro area.</li>\n  <li><strong>Financial inclusion:</strong> a simple wallet could help people without a bank account join digital payments.</li>\n  <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> if a private network fails, a state-backed option keeps payments running.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Trade-off:</em> if it is too attractive to hold digital euros, banks could lose deposits, which might raise loan costs.\nThat is why holding limits and design choices matter.</p>\n\n<h2>The global race</h2>\n<p>Over 100 countries are exploring CBDCs. China’s digital yuan is far along. The Bahamas, Nigeria and Jamaica have already launched.\nEurope’s project is slower and careful, but it would be one of the <strong>largest CBDC pilots in the world</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Big open questions</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Will it <strong>replace cash</strong> or only complement it? (Officials say cash will stay.)</li>\n  <li>Will people <strong>trust</strong> a central-bank wallet as much as their bank’s app?</li>\n  <li>Could governments set <strong>temporary limits</strong> in a crisis (for example, on very large transfers)?</li>\n  <li>Could a successful digital euro <strong>boost the euro’s global role</strong> in trade and finance?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Bottom line</h2>\n<p>The digital euro could make payments <strong>faster, safer and more inclusive</strong>, and strengthen Europe’s independence.\nBut it also raises hard questions about privacy and the role of banks.\nThe choices Europe makes now will decide whether the digital euro becomes a trusted everyday tool or a controversial experiment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"tag\">Note: This explainer summarizes the public discussion around the ECB’s digital euro project as of 2025.
