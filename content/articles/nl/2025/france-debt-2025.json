  "body": "<h2>Key figures (simple overview)</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Total public debt:</strong> about <strong>€3.3 trillion</strong>.</li>\n  <li><strong>Debt-to-GDP ratio:</strong> roughly <strong>114%</strong> (the debt is bigger than one year of the economy).</li>\n  <li><strong>Budget deficit (2025):</strong> around <strong>5.8% of GDP</strong> (EU rule is 3%).</li>\n  <li><strong>EU comparison:</strong> France’s debt ratio is among the highest in the EU (only Greece and Italy are higher). The euro area average is much lower.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure style=\"max-width:860px;margin:16px auto;\">\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/france-debt-2025.png\"\n    alt=\"France’s public debt and deficit in 2025 (simple chart)\"\n    loading=\"lazy\"\n    decoding=\"async\"\n    style=\"width:100%;height:auto;display:block;border-radius:8px;\"\n  />\n  <figcaption style=\"font-size:0.9rem;opacity:0.8;text-align:center;margin-top:6px;\">\n    Source: Eurostat / European Commission (latest quarterly data).\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h2>What does “debt-to-GDP” mean?</h2>\n<p>It shows how big a country’s debt is compared to the size of its economy. If the ratio is 100%, the debt equals one year of everything the country produces. A higher number means a heavier debt burden.</p>\n\n<h2>Political context (why this is in the news)</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>The government announced a <strong>savings plan</strong> of about <strong>€44 billion</strong> to shrink the deficit.</li>\n  <li>One proposal (very controversial) even suggested <strong>scrapping public holidays</strong> to boost output.</li>\n  <li>Opposition parties threatened <strong>no-confidence votes</strong>, so the government’s position is fragile.</li>\n  <li>Public support for cutting holidays is <strong>low</strong>, and protests underline how difficult budget reforms are.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Economic risks (in plain language)</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Rising interest costs:</strong> When rates go up, borrowing becomes more expensive. France already spends tens of billions per year on interest—money that can’t go to schools or hospitals.</li>\n  <li><strong>Credit rating pressure:</strong> If rating agencies downgrade France, borrowing could become even more expensive.</li>\n  <li><strong>Investor nerves:</strong> Political fights make it harder to pass reforms, which can worry markets.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Why this matters (for France and Europe)</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>France is the <strong>second-largest economy</strong> in the euro area. If France struggles, it can affect the whole region.</li>\n  <li>EU fiscal rules say deficits should be <strong>below 3%</strong> and debt <strong>near 60%</strong>. France being far above those levels puts the <strong>credibility of the rules</strong> to the test.</li>\n  <li>Higher French borrowing costs can push up <strong>borrowing costs in other countries</strong> too.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Trends &amp; what to watch</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Deficit path:</strong> Can France reduce the deficit toward 3% without hurting growth?</li>\n  <li><strong>Reforms:</strong> Pension, spending control, and better tax collection are key—but politically hard.</li>\n  <li><strong>New priorities:</strong> Defense, energy support, and climate investments make cutting the deficit tougher.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>FAQ</h2>\n<h3>Why is France’s debt so high?</h3>\n<p>Because the government has run <strong>budget deficits for many years</strong>. Crises (like COVID-19) also pushed spending up. Interest costs and slow growth make it harder to bring debt down.</p>\n\n<h3>What is France’s debt-to-GDP in 2025?</h3>\n<p>About <strong>114%</strong>. That means the total debt is larger than one year of the economy.</p>\n\n<h3>How does France compare to Italy?</h3>\n<p>Italy’s debt ratio is <strong>even higher</strong> (around the upper-130s % of GDP). But France’s ratio is still far above the EU target.</p>\n\n<h3>Will France be downgraded by rating agencies?</h3>\n<p>It’s a <strong>risk</strong>. If deficits stay high and reforms stall, borrowing could get more expensive after a downgrade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"tag\">Source: Eurostat (gov_10q_ggdebt), European Commission.
