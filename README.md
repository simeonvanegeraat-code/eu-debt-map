# EU Debt Map (Clean JS Build)

- JavaScript-only Next.js 14 App Router (works on Vercel)
- Europe map with `react-simple-maps` (no jvectormap)
- Country page has a ticking estimate + sparkline (Recharts)
- Demo data in `lib/data.js`

## Deploy (your flow)
Just replace files in GitHub and push. Vercel will install and build automatically.

(If testing locally: `npm install` then `npm run dev`)
